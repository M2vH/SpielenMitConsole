# Hello World!

Welcome to my project page.  
Nice to have you here.

## Why this page exists?

This project follows the recommendations of a work sheet from the games programming class GPD318 at SAE Institute Cologne. In this project I wanted to show the abilities and borders of a Console-App written in C# using Visual Studio 2017.

## And this is, how it looks like

## You want to play it on your computer?

Fork the repository, open the `SpielenMitConsole.sln` in Visual Studio, build your version and have some fun.
